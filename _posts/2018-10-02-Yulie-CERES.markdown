Yuliana Zamora presented a poster at   [CERES](https://ceres.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html) titled "Data Driven Analysis of GPU Benchmarking". The poster describes  a data-driven framework that makes use of data-analysis tools, such as machine learning and transfer learning, to reduce the time needed for engineers and researchers to predict the performance of a given software kernel on an arbitrary GPU architecture.
