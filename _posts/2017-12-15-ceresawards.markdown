Two Globus labs Ph.D. students received honors at the 2017 annual CERES
summit at the University of Chicago on Sept. 27, 2017.

Tyler Skluzacek, a second year Ph.D. student, received the 'CERES Outstanding Research Award'.
This award is awarded to a graduate student who produces outstanding research
in any area of computer systems as a first year graduate student at the University
of Chicago. 

Yuliana Zamora, a first year Ph.D. student, was named a CERES Scholar at the
event. This award is given to a handful of incoming students intending to
study areas of computer systems who are likely to conduct excellent research
over the course of their graduate studies. The award is accompanied by a cash prize.

The [CERES Center for Unstoppable Computing](https://ceres.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html)
at the University of Chicago is a dynamic community of over sixty researchers across
both industry and academia collaborating to solve problems with solutions in
technical areas of distributed systems, operating systems, HPC, and security.


Congratulations, Tyler and Yulie!
