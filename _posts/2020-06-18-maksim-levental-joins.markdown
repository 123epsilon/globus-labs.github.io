**Maksim Levental** has joined Globus Labs as a PhD student! 
Max earned his BS in Math from Florida State University, and his MS in Computer Science from University of Florida. 
He will be working on problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Distributed HPC.
With this next step taken, Max will finally no longer be a "Florida man" (not that it's considered bad to be a "Florida man",
[unless you wind up in the news](https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-arrested-for-throwing-alligator-through-drive-thru-window)).
Max is still early in his career, though, so anything is possible.
