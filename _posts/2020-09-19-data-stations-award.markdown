The Data Stations project begins with an aim to eliminate hurdles of big data exchange. Dr. Ian Foster states, "The Data Station is a radically new approach that is needed to change how people and organizations thing about, access, and use data". This work will be funded by a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation  as part of the Convergence Accelerator program.
