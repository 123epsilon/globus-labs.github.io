The NIST Center for Hierarchical Materials (CHiMaD) has been extended for an additional 5 years. We are excited to continue expanding on the solid foundation that CHiMaD has built. In the first phase, CHiMaD researchers at NIST, UChicago, Argonne, and Northwestern built new materials for batteries, electric cars, cell phones, electronics, inks for 3D printing, polymers and more. GlobusLabs projects including the Materials Data Facility and the Polymer Property Predictor and Database (PPPDB) are funded through CHiMaD. Through these projects, and the tireless work of others in the community, the data infrastructure to support automated capture of datasets and apply broad machine learning and AI to speed material design is within reach over the next 5 years.[**\[Full Report\]**](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/01/materials-design-center-receives-25-million-grant/)
