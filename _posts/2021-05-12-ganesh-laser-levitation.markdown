Check out this Argonne press on ["Ganesh's PRL"](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.156002). The title "Lasers, levitation and machine learning make better heat-resistant materials" speaks by itself. The collaboration between Chris Benmore from the APS and our Data Science team is making ripples on material science.
