description: "The Materials Data Facility (MDF) project is working to develop and deploy advanced services to help materials scientists publish datasets, encourage data reuse and sharing, and facilitate simple discovery of data."
---

The Materials Data Facility (MDF) acts an interconnection point that allows producers of materials data to dispatch their results broadly and data consumers to discover and aggregate data from independent sources. It streamlines and automates data sharing, discovery, access,
and analysis by: 
1. enabling data publication, regardless of data size, type, and location; 
2. automating metadata extraction from submitted data into MDF metadata records using open-source materials-aware extraction pipelines and ingest pipelines;
3. unifying search across many materials data sources, including both MDF and other repositories with potentially different vocabularies and schemas. 

Currently, MDF stores 40 TB of data from simulation and experiment, and also indexes hundreds of datasets contained in external repositories, with millions of individual MDF metadata records created from these datasets to aid fine-grained discovery.
