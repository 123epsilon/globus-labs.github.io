I"˛<p>The core concept of Colmena is a ‚Äúthinker‚Äù application.
The Thinker application is responsible for intelligently responding to new data, such as by updating a machine learning model or selecting a new simulation with Bayesian optimization.</p>

<p>Colmena provides a few main components to enable building thinker applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A ‚ÄúTask Server‚Äù that provides a simplified interface to HPC-ready workflow systems.</li>
  <li>A high-performance queuing system for interacting with method server(s) from thinking applications.</li>
  <li>An extensible base class for building thinking applications with a dataflow programming model.</li>
</ul>
