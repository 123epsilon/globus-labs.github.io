I"9<p>Ian Foster and Anna Woodard are part of an interdisciplinary team which was awarded a 2020 Cancer Spotlight Grant of $100,000 by the UChicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center Cancer Research Foundation’s Women’s Board. Their project aims to use deep learning on magnetic resonance imaging and genomic data to predict which women are at higher risk of breast cancer and would benefit from more frequent screening, and which could safely reduce their screening frequency. Such a system could lead to more cancers being caught early, when they are curable.</p>
