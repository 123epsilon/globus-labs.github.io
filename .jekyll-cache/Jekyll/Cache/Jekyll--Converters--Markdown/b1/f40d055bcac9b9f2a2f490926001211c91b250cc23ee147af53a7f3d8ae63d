I"‰<p>AL4PFAS is suite of datasets and software workflow for modeling chemical toxicity with a focus on the ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
To address the scarcity of PFAS toxicity data, a deep ‚Äútransfer learning‚Äù method has been investigated by leveraging toxicity information over the entire organic 
chemical domain and an uncertainty-informed workflow by incorporating SelectiveNet architecture, which can support future guidance of high throughput screening with
knowledge of chemical structures, has been developed.</p>
